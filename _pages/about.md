Welcome to my homepage! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institut für Angewandte Mathematik](https://www.ifam.uni-hannover.de/de/) of the [Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/de/). Previously, I worked at the [Faculty of Mathematics](https://mathematik.univie.ac.at/) of the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/), where I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Prof. [Adrian Constantin](https://ucrisportal.univie.ac.at/en/persons/adrian-constantin).

My research is mainly concerned with aspects of fluid dynamics (in particular, with applications to geophysical flows), as well as well-posedness theory for parabolic equations.
